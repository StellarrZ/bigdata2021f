The remaining fields are integers representing *features* present in the document.   In this case, the features are hashed byte 4-grams, represented as integers.

When you use `saveAsTextFile`, Spark will generate one `part-xxxxx` file for each partition of the RDD that you are writing out.

Once the input is parsed, your Spark implementation will have to force all of the instances into a single partition, and then apply the training function to the entire partition.

        "When you train a model using SGD, the model you get depends on the order in which you handle the training instances.  To see this in action, try using the Spark SGD trainer you implemented for Question 2 to train a model from the group_x training set, but with the instances processed in a different order.  \n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, re-implement your trainer from Question 2 so that it will randomly reorder the training instances before using them to update the model. One way to shuffle the training instances is to assign a random sort key to each training instance as you read it from the input file, and then sort the instances using the random sort key.\n",

        "Implement the function `spark_shuffled_SGD` below that takes as input the path to the training dataset, an output path `output_model` and a value for the update parameter `delta`, shuffles the training instances using the method described above and writes the trained model to `output_model` using Spark's `saveAsTextFile`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you have implemented the shuffled trainer, train a model using shuffled group_x training instances, and compare the resulting model with group_x model you learned without shuffling.  It is up to you how to do this comparision.  At a minimum, compare features with the highest weights in each model to see if they are similar. You can also use the classifier in next question to classify documents using the two models, and compare results.\n"
