In this graph, each node represents a server, and each (directed) edge represents a connection between servers in Gnutella's peer-to-peer network.  The input file for this assignment, `p2p-Gnutella08-adj.txt`, represents the graph as an adjacency list.   Each server (node) is identified by a unique number, and each line in the file gives the adjacency list for a single server.\n",
